Guess Game Readme
This is a simple guess game that was inspired by the @jonasschmedtman course on Udemy. The game has been enhanced with new features and functionalities.

Game Description

The objective of the game is to guess the number chosen by the computer. There are three levels: easy, normal, and hard. In the easy level, the player has to guess a number between 1 and 20, while in the normal level, the player has to guess a number between 1 and 50. In the hard level, the player has to guess a number between 1 and 100.

How to Play

Select a game level by clicking on one of the buttons labeled "easy," "normal," or "hard."
The game will display a message that tells the player to start guessing.
Enter a number between the minimum and maximum values of the selected level and click the "Check" button.
The game will give feedback based on the player's guess. If the guess is wrong, the game will reduce the number of tries remaining, and the player can try again. If the guess is correct, the player earns points and moves to the next round.
The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of tries. If the player runs out of tries, the game is over, and the player can choose to play again or quit.
